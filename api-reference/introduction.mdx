# API Reference

Welcome to the Influship API reference. This comprehensive guide covers all endpoints, parameters, responses, and best practices for integrating with our AI-powered influencer discovery and analysis platform.

## Implementation Status

<Warning>
**Important**: The API is in active development. Some endpoints are fully functional while others are in various stages of implementation. Check our [Implementation Status](/implementation-status) page for detailed information about what's working now.
</Warning>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.influship.com
```

## Authentication

The Influship API uses API key authentication. Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.influship.com/health
```

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure! Never share it publicly or commit it to version control. Store it as an environment variable or in a secure configuration file.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage across all clients:

- **Free tier**: 100 requests per hour
- **Pro tier**: 1,000 requests per hour  
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits based on your plan

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

```
RateLimit-Limit: 1000
RateLimit-Remaining: 999
RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header indicating when you can retry.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns errors in a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "The request body is invalid",
    "request_id": "req_123456789"
  }
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `validation_error` | Request validation failed |
| `unauthorized` | API key missing or invalid |
| `forbidden` | Insufficient permissions |
| `not_found` | Resource not found |
| `rate_limited` | Rate limit exceeded |
| `quota_exceeded` | Daily quota exceeded |
| `internal_error` | Server error |

## Data Formats

### Engagement Rates
All engagement rates are expressed as decimal values between 0.0 and 1.0:
- `0.05` = 5% engagement rate
- `0.15` = 15% engagement rate

### Match Scores
Match scores range from 0.0 to 1.0:
- `0.0` = No match
- `1.0` = Perfect match

### Timestamps
All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone:
```
2025-01-15T10:30:00Z
```

### Target IDs
Target identifiers use a platform-prefixed format:
- Creator IDs: `cr_01HZ...` (ULID format)
- Profile IDs: `instagram:username`
- Post IDs: `instagram:post_id`

## Pagination

List endpoints support cursor-based pagination for efficient data retrieval:

```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "filtered_total": 150,
  "has_more": true,
  "next_cursor": "eyJvZmZzZXQiOjIwfQ=="
}
```

To get the next page, include the `cursor` parameter in your request:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.influship.com/v1/search?cursor=eyJvZmZzZXQiOjIwfQ=="
```

## Canonical Endpoint Design

The Influship API uses a canonical endpoint pattern with `targets[]` arrays for efficient batch processing:

### Benefits
- **Single Mental Model**: Pick an action, pass targets, get results
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple targets in one request
- **Consistent API**: All endpoints follow the same pattern
- **Better Performance**: Reduce API calls and improve efficiency

### Example Structure
```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "type": "creator",
      "id": "cr_01HZ..."
    },
    {
      "type": "profile", 
      "id": "instagram:username"
    }
  ],
  "options": {
    "include_evidence": true
  }
}
```

## Webhooks

Configure webhooks to receive real-time notifications about job completion and other events:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_123456789",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "targets": [...]
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
