# Pricing & Credits

The Influship API uses a flexible credit-based pricing system. Pay only for what you use, with transparent costs visible in every response header.

## How Credits Work

Credits are consumed based on request complexity and data returned. **All responses include billing information in headers** so you always know what you're being charged.

<Info>
**Track Every Request** - Monitor `X-Credits-Charged`, `X-Credits-Features`, and `X-Billing-Plan` headers in real-time to understand your usage.

- **Detailed mode**: +0.05 credits per social account included
- **Per seed**: 0.05 credits per seed creator (processing cost)
- **Example**: 3 seeds, 20 creators with detailed profiles (2 accounts each) = (3 √ó 0.05) + (20 √ó 1.0) + (20 √ó 2 √ó 0.05) = 0.15 + 20 + 2 = **22.15 credits**

## Cost Optimization Strategies

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Use Lite Mode First" icon="zap">
  Start with `mode: "lite"` for exploration, upgrade to `detailed` only when needed. Saves 0.04-0.05 credits per social account.
</Card>

<Card title="Batch Requests" icon="layers">
  Use batch endpoints (`/v1/creators`, `/v1/profiles`) to process multiple items in one request. Reduces overhead.
</Card>

<Card title="Cache Aggressively" icon="database">
  Cache frequently accessed creator data for 24-48 hours. Avoid repeated lookups for the same creators.
</Card>

<Card title="Filter Early" icon="filter">
  Use search filters to get fewer, more relevant creators. Better results with lower costs.
</Card>

<Card title="Smart Pagination" icon="list">
  Request appropriate `limit` values. Don't request 100 items if you only need 25.
</Card>

<Card title="Selective Features" icon="toggle-on">
  Only request AI analysis or brand safety when actually needed. Each feature adds cost.
</Card>
