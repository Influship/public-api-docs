# Authentication

The Influship API uses API key authentication to secure access to your account and resources.

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
<Step title="Sign up for an account">
  Visit the [Influship Dashboard](https://dashboard.influship.com) and create a new account.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
  Once logged in, go to the "API Keys" section in your dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate a new key">
  Click "Generate New Key" and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Production App", "Development Testing").
</Step>

<Step title="Copy and store securely">
  Copy the generated API key and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header with every request:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.influship.com/health
```

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.influship.com/health', {
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});
```

### Python Example

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.influship.com/health', headers=headers)
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
**Never expose your API key**: Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

### Environment Variables

Store your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# .env file
INFLUSHIP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
const apiKey = process.env.INFLUSHIP_API_KEY;
```

```python
# Python
import os
api_key = os.getenv('INFLUSHIP_API_KEY')
```

### Key Rotation

<Steps>
<Step title="Generate a new key">
  Create a new API key in your dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Update your applications">
  Update all applications to use the new key.
</Step>

<Step title="Test the new key">
  Verify that all applications work with the new key.
</Step>

<Step title="Delete the old key">
  Once confirmed working, delete the old API key.
</Step>
</Steps>

## API Key Permissions

API keys inherit the permissions of your account:

- **Free Tier**: Basic API access with rate limits
- **Pro Tier**: Enhanced limits and features
- **Enterprise**: Custom permissions and limits

## Error Handling

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "API key is required",
    "request_id": "req_123456789"
  }
}
```

**Common causes:**
- Missing `X-API-Key` header
- Invalid API key
- API key has been deleted or deactivated

### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "forbidden",
    "message": "Insufficient permissions",
    "request_id": "req_123456789"
  }
}
```

**Common causes:**
- API key doesn't have permission for the requested resource
- Account has been suspended
- Feature not available in your plan

## Testing Authentication

Test your API key with the health endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.influship.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "uptime": 12345,
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Key Not Working

1. **Check the header name**: Use `X-API-Key` (not `Authorization`)
2. **Verify the key**: Copy the key exactly as shown in the dashboard
3. **Check account status**: Ensure your account is active
4. **Test with curl**: Use the health endpoint to verify

### Rate Limiting

If you receive rate limit errors:

1. **Check your plan limits**: Verify your current usage
2. **Implement backoff**: Add delays between requests
3. **Upgrade your plan**: Consider upgrading for higher limits
