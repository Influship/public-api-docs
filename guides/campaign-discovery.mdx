# Campaign Discovery Workflow

A step-by-step guide to finding the perfect influencers for your marketing campaigns using the Influship API.

## Overview

This guide walks you through the complete process of discovering influencers, from initial search to final campaign planning.

## Step 1: Define Your Campaign Requirements

Before searching, clearly define your campaign parameters:

- **Target audience**: Demographics, interests, location
- **Campaign goals**: Brand awareness, conversions, engagement
- **Budget constraints**: Follower count ranges, engagement thresholds
- **Content requirements**: Platform preferences, content types

## Step 2: Initial Creator Search

Start with a broad search using natural language:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.influship.com/v1/search' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "query": "fitness influencers who focus on sustainable living and have engaged audiences",
    "filters": {
      "platform_filters": [
        {
          "platform": "instagram",
          "min_followers": 10000,
          "max_followers": 500000,
          "min_engagement_rate": 3.0
        }
      ]
    },
    "limit": 25
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

## Step 3: Analyze Search Results

Review the AI recommendations and scores:

```json Search Results
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
      "name": "Sarah Johnson",
      "ai_recommendation": {
        "score": 0.92,
        "explanation": "High engagement rate (4.5%) and consistent sustainable fitness content"
      },
      "profiles": [
        {
          "platform": "Instagram",
          "username": "sarahfitness",
          "follower_count": 125000,
          "engagement_rate": 4.5,
          "verified": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "filtered_total": 45,
  "has_more": true
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Step 4: Get Detailed Creator Information

For promising candidates, get comprehensive profiles:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.influship.com/v1/creators' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "creator_ids": [
      "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
      "987fcdeb-51a2-43d1-9f12-345678901234"
    ],
    "include_profiles": true,
    "profile_mode": "detailed"
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

## Step 5: Find Lookalike Creators

Use your best candidates as seeds to find similar influencers:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.influship.com/v1/lookalike' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "seeds": [
      {
        "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
        "weight": 1.0
      }
    ],
    "filters": {
      "audience_size": {
        "min": 50000,
        "max": 300000
      }
    },
    "limit": 20
  }'
```
</RequestExample>

## Step 6: Brand Safety Analysis

Before finalizing your campaign, analyze creators for brand safety:

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.influship.com/v1/brand-safety/creators' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "creator_ids": [
      "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
    ]
  }'
```
