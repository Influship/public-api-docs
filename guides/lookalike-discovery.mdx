# Lookalike Discovery

Find creators similar to your seed profiles using AI-powered vector similarity search. The lookalike endpoint supports both creator IDs and platform usernames as seeds, with comprehensive filtering options.

## Overview

The lookalike discovery feature uses advanced AI to find creators with similar characteristics to your seed profiles. It analyzes content style, audience demographics, engagement patterns, and behavioral data to identify the most relevant matches.

- Twitter (coming soon)

## Seed Types

You can provide seeds in multiple ways:

### Creator ID Seeds

Use existing creator IDs from your database:

```json
{
  "seeds": [
    { "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", "weight": 1.0 },
    { "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001", "weight": 0.8 }
  ]
}
```

### Platform Username Seeds

Use social media usernames directly:

```json
{
  "seeds": [
    { "platform": "instagram", "username": "sarahfitness", "weight": 1.0 },
    { "platform": "instagram", "username": "fitnessguru", "weight": 0.8 }
  ]
}
```

### Mixed Seeds

Combine both approaches:

```json
{
  "seeds": [
    { "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", "weight": 1.0 },
    { "platform": "instagram", "username": "fitnessguru", "weight": 0.8 }
  ]
}
```

## Comprehensive Filtering

Apply detailed filters to refine your lookalike results:

```json
{
  "seeds": [...],
  "filters": {
    "platform": ["instagram"],
    "audience_size": {
      "min": 10000,
      "max": 1000000
    },
    "engagement_rate": {
      "min": 0.02,
      "max": 0.1
    },
    "verified": true,
    "country": ["US", "CA"],
    "interests": ["fitness", "wellness"],
    "content_types": ["photos", "videos"]
  }
}
```

### Filter Options

| Filter | Type | Description | Example |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `platform` | Array | Platforms to include | `["instagram"]` |
| `audience_size` | Object | Follower count range | `{"min": 10000, "max": 1000000}` |
| `engagement_rate` | Object | Engagement rate range | `{"min": 0.02, "max": 0.1}` |
| `verified` | Boolean | Verification status | `true` |
| `country` | Array | Country codes (ISO 3166-1) | `["US", "CA"]` |
| `interests` | Array | Content topics/interests | `["fitness", "wellness"]` |
| `content_types` | Array | Content types | `["photos", "videos", "stories"]` |

## Weight System

Seed weights allow you to emphasize certain creators:

- **Weight 1.0**: Standard importance
- **Weight 0.5**: Half importance  
- **Weight 2.0**: Double importance
- **Range**: 0.1 to 10.0

Higher weights make that seed more influential in the similarity calculation.

## AI-Powered Similarity

The lookalike algorithm uses advanced AI techniques:

1. **Vector Embeddings**: Deep learning models analyze creator content and behavior
2. **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Content style, audience demographics, engagement patterns
3. **AI Reranking**: Final results are scored and ranked by AI for optimal relevance

```bash
# First page
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://api.influship.com/v1/lookalike?limit=25"

# Next page using cursor from previous response
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://api.influship.com/v1/lookalike?limit=25&cursor=eyJvZmZzZXQiOjI1fQ=="
```
