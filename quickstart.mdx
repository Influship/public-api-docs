# Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the Influship API! This guide will help you get started with our AI-powered influencer discovery and analysis platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A valid email address for account creation
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs and JSON
- A code editor or API testing tool (we recommend [Postman](https://postman.com) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/))

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

<Steps>
<Step title="Create an account">
  Visit the [Influship Dashboard](https://dashboard.influship.com) and sign up for a new account.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate an API key">
  Once logged in, navigate to the "API Keys" section and click "Generate New Key".
  
  <Warning>
  Keep your API key secure! Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Copy your API key">
  Copy the generated API key and store it securely. You'll need it for all API requests.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Test the API

<Steps>
<Step title="Test the health endpoint">
  Start with a simple health check to verify your API key works:
  
  ```bash
  curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    https://api.influship.com/health
  ```
  
  You should receive a response like:
  
  ```json
  {
    "ok": true,
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "uptime": 12345,
    "version": "0.1.0"
  }
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Test authentication">
  Try making a request without an API key to see the authentication error:
  
  ```bash
  curl https://api.influship.com/health
  ```
  
  This should return a 401 Unauthorized error.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Search for Creators

<Steps>
<Step title="Make your first search">
  Now let's search for some creators. Use a natural language query:
  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.influship.com/v1/search \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "query": "fitness influencers with high engagement",
      "filters": {
        "min_followers": 10000,
        "engagement_rate": {
          "min": 0.03
        }
      },
      "limit": 10
    }'
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Understand the response">
  The response will include:
  - `items`: Array of creator profiles
  - `filtered_total`: Total number of matching creators
  - `has_more`: Whether there are more results
  - `next_cursor`: For pagination
  
  Each creator includes:
  - Basic profile information
  - Engagement metrics
  - AI recommendation score and explanation
  - Content preview
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Enrich Creator Data

<Steps>
<Step title="Get detailed creator information">
  Use a creator ID from your search results to get more detailed information:
  
  ```bash
  curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.influship.com/v1/creators/CREATOR_ID?mode=detailed"
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Get profile by handle">
  You can also get creator data by their platform handle:
  
  ```bash
  curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    "https://api.influship.com/v1/creators/instagram/username?mode=detailed"
  ```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Analyze Content

<Steps>
<Step title="Analyze a post">
  Analyze an Instagram post for content insights:
  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.influship.com/v1/posts/analyze \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "platform": "instagram",
      "url": "https://instagram.com/p/POST_ID",
      "mode": "detailed"
    }'
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Review the analysis">
  The response includes:
  - Post metadata (likes, comments, views)
  - Content analysis (topics, hashtags, mentions)
  - Brand safety rating
  - Call-to-action detection
  - Product mentions
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Match Creators to Campaigns

<Steps>
<Step title="Score creators for a campaign">
  Use match scoring to find the best creators for your campaign:
  
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.influship.com/v1/match \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "creators": [
        {"id": "CREATOR_ID_1"},
        {"id": "CREATOR_ID_2"}
      ],
      "search_intent": {
        "query": "sustainable fashion campaign",
        "context": "Looking for eco-conscious fashion influencers"
      }
    }'
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Review match scores">
  Each creator gets:
  - Match score (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Decision category (good, neutral, avoid)
  - Detailed explanation
  - Supporting evidence
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues

### Authentication Errors
- **401 Unauthorized**: Check that your API key is correct and included in the `X-API-Key` header
- **403 Forbidden**: Your API key may be inactive or have insufficient permissions

### Empty Search Results
- The API requires proper database setup with creator data
- Check the [Implementation Status](/implementation-status) for current limitations

### Rate Limiting
- You may hit rate limits if you make too many requests
- Check the `RateLimit-*` headers in responses
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
