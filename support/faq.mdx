# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### How do I get an API key?

1. Sign up at [dashboard.influship.com](https://dashboard.influship.com)
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section
3. Click **Generate New Key**
4. Copy and store your key securely

### What's the difference between free and pro tiers?

- **Free**: 1,000 requests per hour, basic creator search and profiles
- **Pro**: 10,000 requests per hour, advanced features including email discovery, brand safety analysis, and lookalike matching

### How do I test if my API key works?

Use the health endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY" https://api.influship.com/health
```

## API Usage

### Why am I getting empty search results?

This usually happens when:
- Your search query is too specific or narrow
- The creator database doesn't have data for your target criteria
- You're using filters that exclude all available creators

Try broadening your search terms or removing some filters.

### What platforms are supported?

Currently only Instagram is supported. Additional platforms coming soon.

### How do I handle rate limits?

Rate limit information is in response headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests left this hour
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: When limits reset

### What's the difference between lite and detailed mode?

- **Lite**: Basic creator information including followers, engagement rate, and verification status (default)
- **Detailed**: Extended metrics, additional platform profiles, and premium data like email addresses (requires `include: ["emails"]`)
