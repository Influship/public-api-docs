| Brand safety | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Support | Community | Priority |
| Cost | Free | Custom pricing |

See [Pricing](/essentials/pricing) for complete details.

### How do I test if my API key works?

Test with the health endpoint (no authentication required):

```bash
curl https://api.influship.com/health
```

Then verify authentication with a simple search:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.influship.com/v1/search \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY' \
  -d '{"query": "test", "limit": 1}'
```

## API Usage

### Why am I getting empty search results?

Common reasons:

1. **Query too specific** - Try broader search terms
2. **Filters too restrictive** - Remove some filters
3. **Platform coverage** - Check if the platform is supported
4. **Typos in query** - Double-check spelling

**Example:** Instead of "vegan fitness trainers in San Francisco with 50k-60k followers", try "vegan fitness creators" first, then add filters.

### What platforms are supported?

| Platform | Status | Coverage |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Instagram | ‚úÖ Fully supported | Complete |
| TikTok | üöß Partial support | Growing |
| YouTube | üîú Coming soon | - |
| Twitter/X | üîú Coming soon | - |

<Info>
Instagram is fully supported across all endpoints. TikTok support is expanding.
</Info>

### What's the difference between lite and detailed mode?

**Lite Mode** (`mode: "lite"`)
- Basic creator info (name, bio, avatar)
- Essential metrics (follower count, platform)
- Faster responses
- Lower cost

**Detailed Mode** (`mode: "detailed"`)
- Everything in lite mode
- Extended metrics (engagement rate, avg likes, posting frequency)
- Additional profile data
- Slightly higher cost (+0.04-0.05 credits per social account)

**When to use each:**
- **Lite**: Initial discovery, autocomplete, list views
- **Detailed**: Final analysis, detailed profiles, decision-making

### How do I get creator email addresses?

Email discovery is available in the **Pro tier** only:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.influship.com/v1/creators \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "creator_ids": ["..."],
    "mode": "detailed",
    "include": ["emails"]
  }'
```

**Cost**: Additional 0.5 credits per creator

<Warning>
Emails are provided for legitimate business use only. Respect privacy laws and anti-spam regulations.
</Warning>

### How do I handle rate limits?

Monitor rate limit headers in every response:

```http
RateLimit-Limit: 10000
RateLimit-Remaining: 9997
RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

**Best practices:**
1. Check `RateLimit-Remaining` before making requests
2. Implement exponential backoff for 429 errors
3. Cache responses to reduce API calls
4. Batch requests when possible

See [Rate Limits](/essentials/rate-limits) for implementation examples.

### Can I search for creators on multiple platforms at once?

Yes! The search endpoint returns creators across all supported platforms:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.influship.com/v1/search \
  -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "query": "fitness creators",
    "filters": {
      "platform_filters": [
        {
          "platform": "instagram",
          "min_followers": 10000
        },
        {
          "platform": "tiktok",
          "min_followers": 50000
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

Each platform can have different filter criteria.

### How accurate are engagement rates?

Engagement rates are calculated from recent post data (typically last 12-50 posts) and updated regularly:

**Formula**: `(Likes + Comments) / Followers √ó 100`

**Accuracy:**
- ‚úÖ Very accurate for public accounts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited for private accounts
- üîÑ Updated weekly for active creators

Engagement rates are marked as `null` when insufficient data is available.

## Errors & Troubleshooting

### I'm getting 401 Unauthorized errors

**Possible causes:**

1. **Missing API key**
   ```bash
   # ‚ùå Wrong
   curl https://api.influship.com/v1/search
   
   # ‚úÖ Correct
   curl -H 'X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY' https://api.influship.com/v1/search
   ```

2. **Wrong header name**
   - Must be `X-API-Key` (case-sensitive)
   - Not `Authorization` or `API-Key`

3. **Invalid API key**
   - Check for typos
   - Verify key is active
   - Contact support if issue persists

### I'm getting 429 Rate Limited errors

You've exceeded your hourly request limit:

1. **Check your rate limit:**
   - Free tier: 1,000 requests/hour
   - Pro tier: 10,000 requests/hour

2. **Wait for reset:**
   - Check `RateLimit-Reset` header (Unix timestamp)
   - Or check `Retry-After` header (seconds)

3. **Implement backoff:**
   ```javascript
   if (response.status === 429) {
     const retryAfter = response.headers.get('Retry-After');
     await sleep(retryAfter * 1000);
     // Retry request
   }
   ```

4. **Optimize usage:**
   - Cache responses
   - Batch requests
   - Use debouncing for autocomplete

5. **Upgrade plan:**
   - Contact sales for higher limits

### I'm getting 500 Internal Server errors

This indicates a server-side issue:

1. **Check status page:** [status.influship.com](https://status.influship.com) *(coming soon)*
2. **Note the request ID:** Found in `X-Request-Id` response header
3. **Contact support:** Email [support@influship.com](mailto:support@influship.com) with:
   - Request ID
   - Timestamp
   - Request details (endpoint, parameters)

We typically respond within:
- Free tier: 48-72 hours
- Pro tier: 24-48 hours
- Enterprise: 4-12 hours (SLA guaranteed)

### Creator not found errors

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "creator_not_found",
    "message": "Creator not found: instagram/username"
  }
}
```

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Username typo** - Double-check spelling
2. **Platform mismatch** - Verify the platform is correct
3. **Private/deleted account** - Account may be private or removed
4. **Not in database** - Creator hasn't been indexed yet

**Solution:** Try searching for the creator first using `/v1/search` instead of direct lookup.

## Billing & Pricing

### How much does it cost?

Costs vary by endpoint and features used. Every response includes `X-Credits-Charged` header showing exact cost.

**Common costs:**
- Search: 2.0 credits per creator
- Autocomplete: 0.001 credits per request
- Creator profiles: 0.1 credits per creator
- Brand safety: 2.0 credits per creator

See [Pricing](/essentials/pricing) for complete pricing details.

### How do I monitor my credit usage?

Check response headers:

```http
X-Credits-Charged: 2.5
X-Credits-Features: search,detailed
X-Billing-Plan: pro
```

**Programmatic monitoring:**

```javascript
const creditsUsed = response.headers.get('X-Credits-Charged');
const features = response.headers.get('X-Credits-Features');

console.log(`Used ${creditsUsed} credits for: ${features}`);
```

<Info>
**Usage dashboard coming soon** - Track daily/monthly usage, costs, and trends in real-time.
</Info>

### Do unused credits roll over?

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "insufficient_credits",
    "message": "Insufficient credits. Upgrade your plan or purchase additional credits."
  }
}
```

**Solutions:**
1. Upgrade to Pro tier
2. Purchase additional credit packages

## Best Practices

### How should I cache API responses?

**Recommended TTLs:**

| Data Type | Cache Duration | Reason |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Creator profiles | 24-48 hours | Stable data, infrequent changes |
| Search results | 1-6 hours | Dynamic, relevance may change |
| Autocomplete | 5-10 minutes | Fresh suggestions preferred |
| Brand safety | 7 days | Infrequent re-analysis needed |
| Post data | 24 hours | Engagement metrics update daily |

**Example:**

```javascript
const cache = new Map();

async function getCachedCreator(creatorId) {
  const cacheKey = `creator:${creatorId}`;
  const cached = cache.get(cacheKey);
  
  if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < 86400000) { // 24 hours
    return cached.data;
  }
  
  const data = await fetchCreator(creatorId);
  cache.set(cacheKey, { data, timestamp: Date.now() });
  
  return data;
}
```

### Should I use batch endpoints?

**Yes!** Batch endpoints are more efficient:

```bash
# ‚ùå Inefficient - 3 separate requests
GET /v1/creators/{id1}
GET /v1/creators/{id2}
GET /v1/creators/{id3}

# ‚úÖ Efficient - 1 batch request
POST /v1/creators
{"creator_ids": ["id1", "id2", "id3"]}
```

**Benefits:**
- Fewer API calls
- Lower latency
- Better rate limit usage
- Same cost per creator
