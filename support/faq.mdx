# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the Influship API?

The Influship API is an AI-powered platform for influencer discovery, content analysis, and brand safety evaluation. It helps brands find the right creators for their campaigns and analyze content for brand alignment.

### What platforms does the API support?

Currently, the API supports Instagram. Additional platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter are planned for future releases.

### Is the API free to use?

We offer a free tier with basic functionality and rate limits. Paid plans provide higher limits and additional features. See our [pricing page](https://influship.com/pricing) for details.

## Implementation Status

### What endpoints are currently working?

<Warning>
**Important**: The API is in active development. Check our [Implementation Status](/implementation-status) page for the most current information about what's working.
</Warning>

**Currently Working:**
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ⚠️ Creator search (requires database setup)
- ⚠️ Creator enrichment (legacy endpoints)
- ⚠️ Lookalike search (requires Pinecone setup)

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- ❌ Canonical enrichment endpoint (`POST /v1/enrich`)
- ❌ Canonical analysis endpoint (`POST /v1/analyze`)
- ❌ Brand safety analysis (stubbed)
- ❌ Post analysis (stubbed)

### Why am I getting empty results from search?

The search endpoint requires proper database setup with creator data and Pinecone embeddings. Without these, it will return empty results or errors. Check the [Implementation Status](/implementation-status) for setup requirements.

### What does "live mode" mean?

Live mode fetches fresh data from social media platforms at request time, providing the most up-to-date information. However, live mode is not yet implemented for most endpoints.

## Authentication & API Keys

### How do I get an API key?

1. Sign up at the [Influship Dashboard](https://dashboard.influship.com)
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section
3. Click "Generate New Key"
4. Copy and store your key securely

### How do I use my API key?

Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header with every request:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.influship.com/health
```

### Can I have multiple API keys?

Yes, you can create multiple API keys for different applications or environments. Each key has the same permissions as your account.

### What if I lose my API key?

You cannot recover a lost API key. You'll need to generate a new one and update your applications. We recommend storing API keys as environment variables.

## Rate Limits & Billing

### What are the rate limits?

- **Free tier**: 100 requests per hour
- **Pro tier**: 1,000 requests per hour
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

Rate limit headers are included in all responses.

### What happens when I exceed rate limits?

You'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header indicating when you can retry.

### How is billing calculated?

Billing is based on API requests and data processing. See our [billing guide](/guides/billing) for detailed information.

## Data & Privacy

### What data do you collect?

We collect publicly available social media data and use it to provide our services. We do not collect private or personal information beyond what's publicly accessible.

### How is creator data sourced?

Creator data is sourced from publicly available social media profiles and posts. We respect platform terms of service and privacy settings.

### Can creators opt out?

Creators can contact us to request removal of their data from our platform. We respect privacy requests and will remove data when requested.

## Technical Questions

### What's the difference between "lite" and "detailed" mode?

- **Lite mode**: Basic information with essential metrics
- **Detailed mode**: Comprehensive data including contact information, detailed analytics, and additional metadata

### How does the canonical endpoint design work?

The API uses a canonical pattern with `targets[]` arrays for efficient batch processing:

```json
{
  "targets": [
    {"type": "creator", "id": "cr_01HZ..."},
    {"type": "profile", "id": "instagram:username"}
  ]
}
```

### What are target IDs?

Target IDs use platform-prefixed formats:
- Creator IDs: `cr_01HZ...` (ULID format)
- Profile IDs: `instagram:username`
- Post IDs: `instagram:post_id`

### How does pagination work?

The API uses cursor-based pagination. Include the `cursor` parameter from the previous response to get the next page:

```bash
curl "https://api.influship.com/v1/search?cursor=eyJvZmZzZXQiOjIwfQ=="
```

## Error Handling

### What do the error codes mean?

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `validation_error` | Request validation failed |
| `unauthorized` | API key missing or invalid |
| `forbidden` | Insufficient permissions |
| `not_found` | Resource not found |
| `rate_limited` | Rate limit exceeded |
| `quota_exceeded` | Daily quota exceeded |
| `internal_error` | Server error |

### How should I handle errors?

Implement proper error handling with retry logic for transient errors. Don't retry on authentication or validation errors.

### What's the request ID for?

The request ID helps with debugging and support. Include it when contacting support about specific errors.
