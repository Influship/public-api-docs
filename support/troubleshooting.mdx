Common issues and how to resolve them.

## Authentication Issues

## Search Issues

### Empty Search Results

**Solutions**:

- Try broader search terms (e.g., "fitness" instead of "vegan fitness yoga instructor")
- Remove restrictive filters like `min_followers` or `platform`
- Check that your query is in natural language format
- Verify the search endpoint is working with a simple test query

### Search Errors

**Solutions**:

- Verify your request format

## Data Issues

### Missing Creator Data
